# üëã Hi! 

I'm a 3rd year CS student at the University of Waterloo. I'm interested in a broad range of fields in technology, from processor design to AI, but I'm actively pursuing systems development & backend web development. In my spare time, I'm interested in sports, strategy games, and cooking.

Check out my [website](https://website.davidpeet.md) for more on what I'm tinkering with now!
