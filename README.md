# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

I'm a 3rd year CS student at the University of Waterloo. I'm an implementation nut ðŸ¤“. I'm always curious how software taken for granted works internally, which is probably pretty evident in some of the projects I have pursued, specifically my [memory sanitizer](https://github.com/DavidPeet8/Memory-Sanitizer). 

Check out my [website](https://website.davidpeet.md) for more on what I'm tinkering with now!

**Previously:** `@Axonify` `@McAfee` `@Huawei`

## Say Hello!

I'm always happy to hop on a call and meet new people, If you're interested, feel free to reach out!
